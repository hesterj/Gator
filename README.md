Automated Theorem Prover in C++ with GMP

This is a Hilbert style automated theorem prover for first order logic, and eventually other theories, where every stage of the automated proof is an unconditional tautology (theorem).

Run commands after compile can be found in the main file.  This is in active yet lazy development, if you want to contribute email me or just make an edit to the files if it works.
